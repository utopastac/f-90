The team was made up of everyone from junior picture editors to the directors.\n\nIt's important in a sprint to make sure everyone's voice is heard and heard equally, and we managed to facilitate a very diverse team by challenging their relationships with each other. Tasks were designed to enable people to draw on their experience whilst also being challenged by possibilities they hadn't even considered.", :id => "role"

With the basket and checkout team, in a 4 hour session we created hundreds of potential solutions when the consesnus at the start was choosing between two. By opening up the possibilities to include the fantastical, we ended up expanding the possible.", :id => "role"

Seeing work go from idea to live, interactive test in under a week was genuinely shocking for some.", :id => "circles"

With the basket and checkout team at M&S, we made sure to spend lots of time analyising what we had learned, what was potentially actionable, and what could go straight into a backlog. While only small parts of the prototypes made it into a production environment, the design sprint completely re-ordered their priorities and re-endergised the team.", :id => "circles"
