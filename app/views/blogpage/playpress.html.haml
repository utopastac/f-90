He was very keen to develop a toy range that could offer the same enjoyment he had when he was younger, but be more affordable - giving children the chance to build whole cities for a small price.\n\nI started helping Matthew refine his designs and attempt to build a market strategy. I helped find manufacturing partners, develop a cohesive illustration style, and advise on the brand direction.", :id => "founding"
